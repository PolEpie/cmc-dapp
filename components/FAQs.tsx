							Purchasing a CMC NFT is not an investment. You are purchasing art directly from CMC which will place you as a member in the Club Benefits Program. Benefits range from rewards in crypto, access to hosting services, and beyond!

						<div className='text-[#E3FF89]'>When & How do I get rewarded?</div>

						<p>
							We get this question quite a bit, and the answer is really up to the community as a whole. Our mining operation yields rewards that we put a majority of into the community rewards wallet. From here, the CryptoMiningClub community will get to vote on how these rewards are utilized to grow the project, expand mining operations, and ultimately reward the holders. There are many ways to go about doing each of these things and that is why we want our CMC Community to help us decide what path we go in!
